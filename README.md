## Insight Front­End Challenge

In this challenge, we would like you to create a small JavaScript application around an API. You  
can access the test API at "[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos)".

**Requirements:**
 - Use AJAX to call the API and retrieve the data needed.
 - Build it as a JavaScript single page app. Use a popular JavaScript
   framework   (AngularJS, React or Ember) so we can see how you work
   with established design   patterns.
 - On the main page, display the first 25 thumbnail images in a 5x5
   grid.
 - When a user clicks on a thumbnail, pop up a modal that displays the
   full image (using   `url`) and the title. In the modal, also allow
   the user to add a description (feel free to   design the UX for this
   in whatever way you deem best). Whenever a description is   added,
   persist it so that on refresh the description is still there
   (localStorage is fine).
 - Design of the application is completely up to you. Feel free to use a
   CSS framework like   Bootstrap. This test is more to get a feel for
   your JavaScript knowledge than it is for your   design skills.
 - The application should work on all modern browsers, 2 versions back.
   IE11 is the   furthest IE you have to go back.
 - When we pull down the code, we should be able to get a local
   environment running just   by using `npm install && npm start`
   (either use npm or have the command call another   task runner such
   as gulp or grunt).

**Deliverables:**
 - Provide a .zip, .tar or .tar.gz of your pre­built code. Structure is
   up to you.
 - Make sure to include package.json. Use `engines` so we know what
   version node to   use.

**Bonus points:**
 - Don't use jQuery
 - Use ES2015 (include Babel)
 - Make it responsive
 - Add tests

*Bonus items are absolutely not required. Plan on discussing your project with us, so we want  
you to do and use what you are most comfortable doing/using.*

**FAQ:**
Q. Can I use any additional frameworks, libraries, etc?  
A. Sure, as long as you can explain the reasoning behind why you chose what you chose
